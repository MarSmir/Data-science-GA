### Tim Foley (Course Producer)
As your Course Producer, it's Tim's job to make sure that you (and your instructors) have everything you need for a successful experience in DAT9. **If you've got a question, and you're not sure who to ask, start with Tim!**

Before GA, Tim lived and worked in China as a facilitator and program-designer for youth leadership programs at international schools all over Asia (e.g. student-council retreats, backpacking trips, etc.). After a year abroad, he was ready to move back to the good ol' USA. Tim started out at the front desk as a member of GA's Front Lines team, moved up to "Campus Commander" (yes, a real title), and then in January started as a full-time Course Producer. In addition to Data Science, Tim also produces Front- and Back-End Web Development, Data Analytics, Mobile Development, and Digital Marketing. Tim has been trying to learn Esperanto since high school.
